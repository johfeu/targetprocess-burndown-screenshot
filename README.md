# Targeprocess Burndown Screenshot

Small script to capture Targetprocess burndown chart based on puppeteer
https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer

This is helpful to embed or display burndown charts on e.g. dashboards. Currently the targetprocess 
share functionality only supports boards and other views but not the native burndown chart (top navigation link) 

## Usage
provide username, password and targetprocess burndown link (deep link copied from report) via ENV variable.
Run docker compose
